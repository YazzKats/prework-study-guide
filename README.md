# Prework Study Guide - Project

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript and other Tools/Platforms used.

## Aim and Reason for building this Project
The aim of building this project is to help learn some of the basic initial coding languages and other internal/external, platforms and tools that are used by a front-end developer to build a website from scratch and then deploy it.

## List and descriptions of code, platforms, tools and command interfaces used in this project:

## Code
HTML - HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content.

CSS - CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It's a stylesheet language used to add layout and visual effects to HTML elements. CSS is used specifically for markup languages, in this case HTML.

JavaScript - JavaScript is a scripting language used to develop web pages. Developed in Netscape, JS allows developers to create a dynamic and interactive web page to interact with visitors and execute complex actions. It also enables users to load content into a document without reloading the entire page.

## Platform
GitHub - GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere. GitHub essentials are repositories, branches, commits, and pull requests.

## Tools
Chrome DevTools - Chrome DevTools is a set of web developer tools built directly into the Google Chrome browser. These tools let you inspect the rendered HTML (DOM) and network activity of your pages. You can use DevTools to troubleshoot ad serving issues.

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) - Visual Studio Code includes built-in JavaScript IntelliSense, debugging, formatting, code navigation, refactorings, and many other advanced language features.

## Command Line
CLI - A command line interface (CLI) is a text-based interface where you can input commands that interact with a computer's operating system. 

Gitbash - Git Bash is an application for Microsoft Windows environments which provides an emulation layer for a Git command line experience.



## Problem this Project Solved
The Prework Study Guide is now easier to access, allowing the student to take notes during the complete course. 
Making it a one stop note taking station, from the begining to the end of the course. All notes would be in sync with modules, making it a quick reference point, also a great help with revision.


## What I learned after completing this Project
How to build a website from scratch, using HTML for the structure and content, CSS to style it, and JavaScript to make it dynamic and interactive, also using less code lines, example by changing 'if' to 'for' loop. 
Use Chrome DevTools to inspect the index.html file allowing me to troubleshoot issues directly from the browser, in console tab.
Using GitBash to create feature branches, using git pull/push to main branch on remote repository in GitHub. GitHub ia where you are debugging, using New pull request, merging of feature branches with main branch to keep upto date and closing issues takes place. Concluding with writing up a README file and launching the deployemnt of the website.

## Future Possibilities
User Interface could be more attractive and user friendly
Search for words, allowing quick access to info

## Installation

None

## Usage

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
